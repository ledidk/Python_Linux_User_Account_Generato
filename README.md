# Python_Linux_User_Account_Generato

This script, `gentlest.py`, is a python script that generates random usernames and creates corresponding user accounts in a Linux environment using Python and Linux commands. The script generates a list of random usernames and writes them to a file named "usernames.txt." It then reads the usernames from the file and uses the `os.system()` function to create user accounts with the specified usernames and set appropriate permissions for the home directory of each user.
